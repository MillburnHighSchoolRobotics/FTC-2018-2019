/**
 * The navXPIDController implements a timestamped PID controller (designed to deal
 * with the jitter which is typically present in a networked control system scenario).
 * <p>
 * The navXPIDController can use any of the various data sources on a navX-Model device
 * as an input (process variable); when instantiating a navXPIDController simply
 * provide an AHRS class instance and specify which navX-Model device variable you
 * wish to use as the input.  Then, configure the navXPIDController's setPoint,
 * outputRange, whether it should operate in continuous mode or not, and the
 * P, I, D and F coefficients which will be used to calculate the output value.
 * <p>
 * An example of using the navXPIDController to rotate a FTC robot to a target angle is
 * provided <a href="http://navx-micro.kauailabs.com/examples/rotate-to-angle/">online</a>.
 * <p>
 * The general PID algorithm used herein is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">discussed in detail on Wikipedia.</a>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to the P,I,D terms, a FeedForward term is optionally available
 * which may be useful in cases where velocity is being controlled (e.g., to
 * achieve a continuous rotational velocity using a yaw rate gyro).  The FeedForward
 * concept is discussed further <a href="http://www.expertune.com/articles/UG2007/PIDControlsPLCEnviron.pdf">here.</a>
 * <p>
 * This algorithm implements two features with respect to the integral gain calculated
 * based on the integral (i) coefficient:
 * <p>
 * - Anti-Windup:  Ensures the integral gain doesn't exceed the min/max output range, as discussed
 *   <a href="http://www.expertune.com/articles/UG2007/PIDControlsPLCEnviron.pdf">here.</a>
 * - Time-Correction:  Adjust the integral gain in cases when timestamps indicate that
 *   data samples were lost.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm implements this feature with respect to the derivative gain, as discussed
 *   <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:570067/FULLTEXT01.pdf">here.</a>
