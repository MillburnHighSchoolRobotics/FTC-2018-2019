/**
 * The IDataArrivalSubscriber interface provides a method for consumers
 * of navX-Model device data to be rapidly notified whenever new data
 * has arrived.
 *
 * Two separate "callback" functions are provided:
 *
 * - timesetampedDataReceived():  reception of sensor-timestamped data
 * - untimestampedDataReceived():  reception of data without a sensor-
 *     provided timestamp.
 *
 *  Both timestamps are at millisecond resolution.  A "system timestamp"
 *  is provided in both casees, which represents as accurately as possible
 *  the time at which this process acquired the data.
 *
 *  If available, sensor timestamps are preferred, as they are generated
 *  by a real-time system and thus have a greater accuracy than the
 *  system timestamp which is vulnerable to latencies introduced by the
 *  non-realtime Android operating system.
 *
 *  To support data retrieval of various different types of data from a
 *  single data publisher, a "kind" object is also provided which can be
 *  used to indicate the type of data being referred to in the
 *  notification.
 *
 *  This callback is invoked by the AHRS class whenever new data is r
 *  eceived from the sensor.  Note that this callback is occurring
 *  within the context of the AHRS class IO thread, and it may
 *  interrupt the thread running this opMode.  Therefore, it is
 *  very important to use thread synchronization techniques when
 *  communicating between this callback and the rest of the
 *  code in this opMode.
 *
 *  The sensor_timestamp is accurate to 1 millisecond, and reflects
 *  the time that the data was actually acquired.  This callback will
 *  only be invoked when a sensor data sample newer than the last
 *  is received, so it is guaranteed that the same data sample will
 *  not be delivered to this callback more than once.
 *
 *  If the sensor is reset for some reason, the sensor timestamp
 *  will be reset to 0.  Therefore, if the sensor timestamp is ever
 *  less than the previous sample, this indicates the sensor has
 *  been reset.
 *
 *  In order to be called back, this interface must be registered
 *  via the AHRS registerCallback() method.
